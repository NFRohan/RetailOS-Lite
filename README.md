RetailOS Lite is an AI-native retail execution system for field rep store visits, shelf image analysis, compliance scoring, fraud detection, governed outlet master data, supervisor dashboards, and RAG-based operational intelligence.

Built as a 72-hour rapid sprint project, it is intentionally local-first for demo reliability while keeping production-shaped boundaries: async queues, isolated AI service, durable database state, structured observability, RBAC, offline sync, and deployable container services.

## Development Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start Next.js locally |
| `npm run build` | Build the Next.js app |
| `npm run check:worker` | Type-check worker code |
| `npm run worker` | Run the BullMQ worker locally |
| `npm run db:push` | Push Prisma schema to the database |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed demo users, outlets, and visits |
| `npm run rag:index-reports` | Re-index visit reports into Pinecone |
| `npm run test:outlet-resolution` | Exercise outlet matching and duplicate prevention |

## AI Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Image[Shelf image] --> Fraud[Fraud checks]
  Fraud --> YOLO[YOLO product detection]
  YOLO --> POSM[OpenAI POSM audit]
  POSM --> Score[Compliance scoring]
  Score --> Report[Visit report]
  Report --> Embed[OpenAI embedding]
  Embed --> Pinecone[(Pinecone)]
  Report --> Assistant[RAG assistant context]
```

YOLO provides grounded product and competitor detections. OpenAI is used where classical detection is intentionally weaker for the sprint: POSM recognition, shelf quality reasoning, supervisor-ready summaries, and assistant answer generation. Compliance remains deterministic so scores are inspectable and stable.

## Data Model Snapshot

Primary operational entities:

- `Visit`, `VisitImage`, `AIResult`, `FraudSignal`, `VisitReport`
- `Outlet`, `OutletAlias`, `OutletSubmission`
- `EventLog` for workflow timelines and operational debugging
- User/session records for Auth.js and RBAC

Outlet management is governed master data, not simple CRUD. Reps submit names and GPS quickly; the system resolves possible matches, creates pending outlets when needed, and lets supervisors approve, reject, or merge duplicates without orphaning visit history.

## Observability

RetailOS Lite exposes both external observability and in-product operational visibility:

- Sentry captures app, worker, and AI service errors with correlation IDs.
- Structured JSON logs are written for web, worker, and AI service.
- Prometheus scrapes queue, worker, AI, assistant, and latency metrics.
- Loki and Tempo back local logs and traces.
- Grafana ships with provisioned local dashboards.
- `/supervisor/ops` shows queue health, failed jobs, recent events, assistant timing, and per-visit processing timelines.

## Production Path

The demo stack is local-first, but the boundaries map cleanly to cloud infrastructure:

- Next.js app on Vercel, ECS, or another container platform
- Worker and FastAPI service as separate containers
- RDS PostgreSQL with PgBouncer or Prisma Accelerate
- ElastiCache Redis for BullMQ
- S3 or Cloudflare R2 for image storage through the existing storage abstraction
- Secrets Manager or platform secrets for OpenAI, Pinecone, Twilio, Sentry, and auth secrets
- Managed Grafana or hosted Sentry for production observability

Known hardening items before production: signed direct uploads, Redis/WAF-backed distributed rate limits, mandatory AI-service authentication outside local, database connection pooling, and full object-storage migration away from local demo uploads.

## Project Status

RetailOS Lite is showcase-ready for the sprint assessment: the critical business workflow is complete, AI processing is asynchronous, the supervisor experience is operationally useful, and the system demonstrates multiple bonus capabilities without turning the codebase into a science project.
