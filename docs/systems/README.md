# RetailOS Lite System Documentation

This directory is the subsystem-level handoff pack for RetailOS Lite. It is intended for senior engineers reviewing architecture, boundaries, operational behavior, and demo readiness.

## Current Production Shape

RetailOS Lite is a local-first demo system with production-shaped boundaries:

- Next.js owns product UI, auth, API routes, and dashboard queries.
- PostgreSQL/Prisma owns operational state.
- Redis/BullMQ owns async work.
- Node worker owns analysis orchestration, fraud checks, persistence, alerts, and report indexing.
- FastAPI owns AI inference, POSM analysis, compliance scoring, embeddings, and assistant generation.
- Pinecone owns vector memory.
- LGTM/Sentry/EventLog expose operational visibility.

The project is optimized for a 72-hour sprint assessment, so several systems are intentionally pragmatic rather than enterprise-complete. Those tradeoffs are called out in each subsystem doc.
